Hi, I’m Bradley (8bitpineapple)

Also refer to my itch.io for game projects I am working on https://8bitpineapple.itch.io/ .

I'm going to experiement with the GoDot game engine and potentially make some open source games for learning/fun.

Will also be working on a pretty niche project, e.g. a map for the Discworld Mud (A sort of text based mmo from 1992).
It's a pretty fun application of Graph Theory, there's around a million or so nodes that relate to a position of the Discworld.
With pretty cool in depth city maps like the one of Ankh-Morkpork - https://dw.daftjunk.com/Ankh-Morpork.png
  
Lots of credit Kefka https://dw.daftjunk.com/ , Airk, and Quow http://www.quow.co.uk/
Since I make use of their map images and Quow's SQL database.
